### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I am Sean O'Connor (he/him), a full stack hobbyist developer from the gorgeous Denver metro area in Colorado. When I am not at my day job I love to program-- working on my small projects, researching new tech, or advancing my knowledge. Feel free to shoot me an email me at **so (at) seano.dev** if you want to chat!

### ðŸ”­ Some of my projects ...
- [seano.dev](https://www.seano.dev/) - my personal website, made with Next.js.
- [anibl.co](https://anibl.co/) - a fairly straight forward url shortening service made with Express and MongoDB.
- [Steam Browser](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/steam-browser/) - a Firefox and Chromium extension to open Steam pages in the desktop app.
- [Blocky Warrior](https://seano.itch.io/blocky-warrior) - a 48 hour game jam project made in Unity3d.
